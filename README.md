# Lostcpp

Lostcpp is a simple 3D game using OpenGL 3.3 Core. Here we don't want using or creating any game engine, because we don't really want any kind of abstractions.
We use an ECS to manage and ease all the creation of Entities and its Components.

## Preview & Status

![preview](https://github.com/sgf4/lostcpp/blob/master/images/preview.png?raw=true)

## Build

Build lostcpp using the following commands

```bash
  git clone https://github.com/sgf4/lostcpp
  cd lostcpp
  git submodule update --init --recursive --depth 1
  mkdir build 
  cd build
  cmake .. -DCMAKE_BUILD_TYPE=Release
  make -j 4
```

For cross compiling you will need using MSYS2 or Arch Linux using `x86_64-w64-mingw32-cmake` instead cmake

## How works our ECS?
Firstly uses Worlds, which contain their self ComponentManager. The ComponentManager has a group of `std::unique_ptr<ComponentSystem<T>>` for each Component we have. When we load a Component will instance its `ComponentSystem<T>`. `ComponentSystem<T>` is based of `BasicComponentSystem<T>` which has its own `std::vector<T>` of Components grouping all the same Components of its own type avoiding branching. The `BasicComponentSystem<T>` is compiled for each Component so when we add a new component to our entity, we don't even need to #include the component, will be only needed to include it when we want to work with that specific component such as call its functions. 
We can also use template specification to override the `ComponentSystem<T>` in our own component, to load specific resources when we load some Components.
