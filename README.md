# Lostcpp

Lostcpp is a simple 3D game using OpenGL 3.3 Core. Here we don't want using or creating any game engine, because we don't really want any kind of abstractions.

## Build

Build lostcpp using the following commands

```bash
  git clone https://github.com/sgf4/lostcpp
  cd lostcpp
  git submodule update --init --recursive --depth 1
  mkdir build 
  cd build
  cmake .. 
  make -j 4
```
